Forging is a technology that is built using trial and error method over a period of time, it was an experience oriented technology. The hammer when used over a billet impresses an impulse force. The billet and mass absorb the mass and undergo displacement. For this experiment, the displacement of the masses are simulated when an impulse force is acted upon it.

The displacement for the masses are calculated as,

<h3>The equation for the experiment is as follows</h3>

<p>The X1 and X2 are the  static amplitudes </p>
<p>The x1 and x2 are the dynamic amplitudes which is the cos function of time</p>
<p>the x10 and x20 is the initial amplitude</p>
<p>the x1d and x2d is the initial velocity  assumption  which is 0 in this case</p>

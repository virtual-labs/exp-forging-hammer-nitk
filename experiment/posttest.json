      "explanations": {
        "a": "Resonance depends on mass and stiffness",
        "b": "In forced vibrations the system is periodically excited",

        "a": "It is safe to operate below natural frequency",
        "b": "It is safe to operate above natural frequency",
        "c": "Since the amplitude is maximum at natural frequency, it is not safe to operate",

      "question": "A forging system should have a heavy base:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To shift natural frequency from excitation frequency",
        "b": "As all modes are excited from the impact",
        "c": "If not the final workpiece will deform",
        "d": "All the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "If impact force and the first natural frequency matches, the billet will break",
        "b": "Increased stifness will ensure a considerable shift in natural frequency",
        "c": "Deformation should be to a minimum, when in a forge",
